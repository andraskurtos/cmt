**CAMBRIDGE MOBILE TELEMATICS JOB INTERVIEW ASSIGNMENT**
*made by Andr√°s Kurtos*

This game was created as an assignment for a job interview at *Cambridge Mobile Telematics*
Can be run locally by pulling repository, then running the *"npm start"* command from a terminal in the *app* directory.
CSS assets have been partially reused from my older project, *https://github.com/andraskurtos/szoval*
